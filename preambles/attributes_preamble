Attribute Reference
===================

This chapter shows all the attributes that can be set to control the
behavior of VisIt. The attributes themselves are not documented, but
their names are usually quite explanatory. When an attribute can have
values from a given list of options, the default option is printed and
the other available options are printed in a column beneath in italic.

The listing is ordered in alphabetical ordering of the name of the
attribute set. For each set the function that will provide you with
these attributes is printed in italic.
