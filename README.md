# VisIt Python Manual (Sphinx edition)

Welcome to the home of VisIt's Sphinx python manual. 

### Structure
This manual is comprised of many restructuredText files (.rst), some of which can be edited directly when changes are needed, and others of which are generated through a python script named "sphinx\_extractor.py". 
*IMPORTANT*: the scripts that are generated by the sphinx\_extractor must NOT be edited by hand. 

*restructredText files that can be edited by hand*
1. index.rst 
2. intro.rst
3. python.rst
4. quickrecipes.rst
5. acknowledgments.rst

*restructredText files that must NOT be edited by hand*
1. attributes.rst
2. events.rst
3. functions.rst


Information about attributes, events, and functions are pulled directly from VisIt and must be updated through VisIt. 

### Generating 
To generate attributes, events, and functions, simply evoke the sphinx\_extractor script with your VisIt src/bin directory as an argument like so:

    python sphinx_extractor.py path/to/visit/src/bin

Once done, the appropriate files will be updated or written if neccessary.
